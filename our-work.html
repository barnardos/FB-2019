								<h2 class="Heading textPink">Championing children’s voices and user-centred design</h2>

								<p class="Paragraph">This year we ran 12 discovery projects to better understand the experiences and challenges of the young people we support, from having a first conversation about mental health to leaving care more confidently. Much of our work focuses on Barnardo’s three core priority programmes (CPPs).</p>

								<br/>

								<h2 class="Subheading">1. Child sexual abuse (CSA)</h2>
								<ul class="BulletedList">
									<li class="ListItem">We’ve investigated how to better identify and assess children at risk.</li>
									<li class="ListItem">We’re proposing a national sexual abuse risk assessment framework.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2 class="Subheading">2. Children in and leaving care (CILC)</h2>
								<ul class="BulletedList">
									<li class="ListItem">In partnership with CareTech Foundation, we built Journey, an app to build self-sufficiency in leaving care. We are testing it before rolling it out in 2020.
									</li>
									<li class="ListItem">With Plymouth Council we have focused on how we can better support young people to move on from care and reduce loneliness.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2 class="Subheading">3. Mental health and wellbeing (MHWB)</h2>
								<ul class="BulletedList">
									<li class="ListItem">We worked with health and social care professionals and educators to understand the mental health and wellbeing experiences of children, young people and their families.</li>
									<li class="ListItem">We won funding from Nominet #RESET Mental Health programme to create a library of design patterns for mental health, working with Barnardo’s business development unit, and partners Snook and Public Policy Lab. These are individual building blocks – best practice modules which Barnardo’s and others can use to develop better, more consistent approaches to children’s mental health support.</li>
								</ul>

								<br/>

								<h2 class="Subheading">New resources for practitioners and partners</h2>
								<ul class="BulletedList">
									<li class="ListItem">To improve the way we communicate with children and young people at the very start of their journey with us, we worked with our B4U service in Hampshire to create an online onboarding site delivered straight to mobile phones. Written in simple child-friendly language, it sets out what to expect and provides a safe and trusted communication channel. We’re piloting this and aim to roll it out to all children’s services in 2020.</li>
									<li class="ListItem">The Ethical Research toolkit helps make sure consent is truly informed and freely given, and that young participants feel respected and comfortable to take part in research. We’ve published this on Inside Barnardo’s so all social care practitioners can benefit. We’ll be expanding it soon to include an explanatory video.</li>
									<li class="ListItem">Our Design System makes it easier, faster and cheaper to create online content and services that are consistent and accessible. Our new apps, the website, fundraising campaigns and children’s service listings all now use the Design System, ensuring a distinctive and consistent Barnardo’s look and feel to everything we do.

					<div class="Column">
						<p class="Paragraph">
							We’ve helped develop Barnardo’s 10-year partnership with Leicestershire County Council (LCC). As part of the partnership we’re testing a new approach to help children and young people going into residential care settings. Our work was highly commended for the 2019 Go Procurement Innovation of the Year Award.

							Transforming the way we store, share and use data
						</h2>

						<p class="Paragraph">
							We are working with Barnardo’s children’s services, finance, fundraising and strategic impact teams to test new ways of using data to create real insights that inform our work and better help our young people and supporters.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<h2 class="Subheading">
							Better data reporting
						</h2>
						<p class="Paragraph">
							We are trialling Tableau, a data visualisation tool. We’re testing how well it helps us meet our stakeholders’ need for data insight and reporting, prepare better quality reports, and save time in our day-to-day work.
						</p>
						<br/>
						<h2 class="Subheading">
							Better social care case management
						</h2>
						<p class="Paragraph">
							Eclipse is a case management system centred around each child we work with, not each unique intervention. It will replace our current service user recording system and captures children’s data in a more consistent way, improving recording practice and giving us better-quality data to understand the impact we are having and what interventions work best.
						</p>
						<p class="Paragraph">
							We trialled Eclipse with the RU Safe service in Aylesbury, and adapted it to meet the needs of children’s services colleagues. We will extend the pilot early in 2020.

							A new mental health case management system

								Our website is the first place most people go to find out more about who we are, what we do and how to sign up to volunteer, commission us and donate to our services. It is a critically important face for Barnardo’s and we need it to work hard for us. This year we redesigned it to help people find the information they need quickly and easily.  We also made it easier to donate money and to use the site on mobile phones and tablets.

								We created, or developed further, two channels to help colleagues communicate, learn, share and celebrate their work.

							<ul class="BulletedList">
								<li class="ListItem">
									Inside Barnardo’s – our intranet without walls. This is the go-to place for policies, guidance and resources. Accessible to all colleagues and – for the first time – volunteers, wherever you are, from any device.

									Workplace – our social network for work, helping people connect, build networks and interest groups and share success.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3 class="Subheading">New kit</h3>
							<p class="Paragraph">
								We are providing IT and software that will make it easier and more efficient for us all to do our jobs – and ensuring everyone knows how to use it.  Over 500 colleagues are trialling G Suite and/or new laptops and ways of working. Reactions are really positive, with our piloteers loving the fact that they can switch on their new laptops and just start work.  The new technology will roll out in 2020, starting in Wales.

								<p class="Paragraph">
									We’ve launched the #FutureBarnardos Champions – a network of teammates to inspire and support their colleagues to feel confident and empowered to embrace change. The Champions will be among the first to test our new kit and ways of working, so they can share knowledge with their colleagues and feed back to us, making sure all our new services and products are fit for purpose.

									We’re sharing agile ways of working with colleagues across Barnardo’s and our partners, and developing our in-house talent by offering digital reskilling opportunities.

										In preparation for the introduction of new kit for all colleagues we are getting all the support structures in place, including conducting a major review of our security systems.

									<p class="Paragraph">

										We’ve set up the IT for two major new contracts, working with a number of partner organisations to ensure our children’s services were fully functioning from day one.

										We’ve worked with colleagues in marketing and facilities management to introduce new IT systems to help them do their jobs more effectively.

										We’ve completed a discovery phase to identify what we need to replace our HR and finance applications, which will help us procure the best solution.
