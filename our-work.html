							<ul class="BulletedList">
								<li class="ListItem">To improve the way we communicate with children and young people at the very start of their journey with us, we worked with our B4U service in Hampshire to create an online onboarding site delivered straight to mobile phones. Written in simple child-friendly language, it sets out what to expect and provides a safe and trusted communication channel. We’re piloting this and aim to roll it out to all children’s services in 2020.</li>
								<li class="ListItem">The Ethical Research toolkit helps make sure consent is truly informed and freely given, and that young participants feel respected and comfortable to take part in research. We’ve published this on Inside.Barnardos so all social care practitioners can benefit. We’ll be expanding it soon to include an explanatory video.</li>
								<li class="ListItem">Our Design System makes it easier, faster and cheaper to create online content and services that are consistent and accessible.. Our new apps, the website, fundraising campaigns and children’s service listings all now use the Design System, ensuring a distinctive and consistent Barnardo’s look and feel to everything we do. https://design-system.barnardos.org.uk/</li>
